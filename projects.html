        <h1>Submarine Game</h1>
        <p>This was a project for a web programming course in college that I had a lot of fun with. 
            The basic premise was to create a Space Invaders style game in which you shoot projectiles from 
            a player controlled ship and try to hit enemies falling from the top of the screen. In my version however,
            the player controlls a submarine, and shoots torpedos at sharks. What I enjoyed most about this
            project was adding lots of randomness to the game mechanics. For example, the sharks spawn at random 
            points along the top of the screen, the movement of the sharks is randomized, and the initial speed 
            and acceleration of each torpedo that the player fires is also random. I learned a lot about the basic 
            structure of a game through this project, as well as the capabilities of JavaScript. The game is playable 
            your browser, so if you'd like to check it out, it can be played <a href="./Space Shooter/space_shooter.html">here!</a>
        </p>
        <p>Eventually, I may come back to this project to improve it or use it as a touchstone for creating other basic
            games that could be played in a browser.

        <h1>Handy Bot</h1>
        <p>Handy Bot is a Discord bot that I made as a general utility tool for use in a Discord server that I use
            with some friends. Handy Bot has an ever expanding list of functions for helping out (and causing chaos)
            around the Discord server. These functions include:

        <h3>RollDie</h3>
        <p>RollDie is a function to roll a die with any number of sides (default 6) any number of times (default 1).</p>
        <h3>Kick</h3>
        <h3>Teams</h3>
        <h3>Timeout</h3>
